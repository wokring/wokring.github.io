# Question 2 - Takeaways from AI
Initially, when I heard the word *AI* or *machine learning* I used to think that it was some black box where it was able to take some input and return you back what you wanted. I also thought that the math behind it was too complicated for me. However, after taking the time to learn about what *AI* means through ELEC4360 and the *fastai* course, I have come to realise that it is not as difficult as I initially thought.

For example, to have a simple understanding of what deep learning is, I thought that I needed to know a lot of math; I needed lots of data to produce a reasonable model; and I required expensive hardware to train these models. However, intead, I only needed high school math; only need a relavant amount of samples; and a normal working computer.

The reason for not needing a huge amount of samples is because one can train ontop an existing base model to not only allow faster training times but also it can reduce the amount of data needed to train because it was generally trained. As for the hardware, everyday computers are now fast enough to handle such tasks.
